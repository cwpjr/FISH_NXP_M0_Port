FISH QUICK TUTORIAL 2013 CWPJR

To take good advantage of FISH, please understand this runs in a
smaller embedded ARM CORTEX M0 environment. This typically means 4k of ram.

XXXX:	        Indicates a topic, note or section header.

	Words in all caps (except FISH) are WORDS in FISH.
	( Text ) are comments here and in FISH.
	[ WORD ] Discusses a particular WORD in FISH.
	If tried in FISH terminal implies pressing enter ( CR ) last to process.
	
	FISH syntax is simple; space seperates words and numbers.
	Processing of the words and numbers begins after CR entered.
	
[ BASE ]
	FISH boots in HEX. Many numbers in programming are best expreseed in HEX.
	[ . ] prints the 32bit number on the stack in the current base.
	HEX, DECIMAL and BIN set the base used in numeric input and output.
	For example setting the desired baud-rate is best done in decimal.
        [ DECIMAL 9600 MYBAUD ] ( remember you are in decimal now! )
	See also ( .D .H .B and other .words in the glossary )

RESET:
	FISH may or may not issue a SIGNON message when powered up.
	Enter CR and expect OK prompt thru serial terminal at default baudrate.
	Now that FISH is powered up there are only 3 ways to see the SIGNON message.
	BYE and COLD reboot FISH if you use them and print out the SIGNON message.
	If you end up feeding FISH garbage that violates the hardware rules
	a Hard Fault Reset will ooccur and you will see 2 special characters,
	then 2 CR's and then the SIGNON message.
	Try this: [ 1 1 ! ]
	
	FISH has a default baudrate. It can be changed with the words
	MYBAUD, then INIT_UART0. [ DECIMAL 9600 MYBAUD INIT_UART0 HEX ]
	Now the new baud rate will be preserved during reset.

( Writing FISH software )
	Test your work interactively in the terminal screen.
	Copy good work and paste it to text files.
	The terminal program can now be used to download your good code from the text file.
	It is confusing to see a text file download and process errors in buggy code.
	Depending on what broke in the download a Hard Fault Reset may be triggered.
	If so you'll have to start the downloads again.
	Thats why I advise testing in the terminal and only downloading know good code.

[ .DS ]:
	This WORD will show you how much dictionairy space is available.
	No matter what base you are in it will leave that base intact while
	displaying the available space in DECIMAL.
	
[ .VS ]:
	This WORD will show you how much RAM Variable space is available.
	[ VAR TESTVAR ] takes no argumant and allocates 4 bytes.
	No matter what base you are in it will leave that base intact while
	displaying the available space in DECIMAL.

( Managing your Dictionary of WORDS )
	Try this [ WORDS ]. You'll see a list of words in the dictionary.
        MYWORDS will list only words you have added or saved to flash.
	Use .DS and .VS to monitor availavble space for Words and Var's.
	
FORGET:
	[ FORGET WORDname ] removes all Words after WORDname ( including wordname )
	and prints out the HEX address where next new Word will be added.

FLASH_FORGET:
	[ FLASH_FORGET ] removes all Words saved in flash.

( MATH )
	FISH does math like a HP calculator of old. Numbers are put on The Stack.
	Math operators then use the numbers on The Stack and replace then with results.
	See +. -. /, /MOD to start. All are 32 bit integer operations.
	64- Bit operators are available. See M/MOD, D+, D. etc.
	NOTE: 64 bit representation is used internally a lot,
	even for 32 bit Words like [ . ].
